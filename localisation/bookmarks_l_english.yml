 POKEMON_WORLD_NAME:0 "The Pokemon World"
 POKEMON_WORLD_DESC:0 "The peace the world has enjoyed for the past 200 years is appearing more and more tenuous, as criminal gangs are popping up and threatening the governments of Kanto and Jhoto, and the once eliminated Aether Foundation threatens to use the Ultra Beasts to secure world domination. In the north, the newly unified Galar Empire is looking outwards and refuses to join the League of Seven Nations despite holding its own Pokemon League, and the policy of containment is showing its flaws."
 SIN_POKEMON_WORLD_DESC:0 "The past thirty years have proved transformative for the Sinnoh region, who now see themselves at the pinnacle of the League of Seven Nations. The industrialization programs have ensured the Sinnoh region is renowned around the world for its prosperity as much as its culture and beautiful contests. Recently, with Cynthia's intensive development of Celestic Town, her hometown, she has drawn opposition by the more traditional elements of Sinnoh society, and far-right partisans have been threatening the peaceful rule of the Champion."
