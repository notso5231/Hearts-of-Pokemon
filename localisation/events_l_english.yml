 sinnoh.1.t:0 "Abdication of Cynthia"
 sinnoh.1.d:0 "The democratic protestors have taken de facto control of the government of Sinnoh, and have marched on the Pokemon League, forcing Cynthia to abdicate. She is now believed to be living in her mansion in Celestic City."
 sinnoh.1.a:0 "Will this madness ever end?"
 sinnoh.2.t:0 "Widespread Protests"
 sinnoh.2.d:0 "Unfortunately, our apathy in dealing with right wing protestors has empowered those elsewhere on the political spectrum to exploit the government's weakness."
 sinnoh.2.a:0 "There is nothing we can do."
 sinnoh.2.b:0 "Embrace the far right, they may bring order at least."
 sinnoh.2.b.tt:0 "This will lock you into the §R fascist §!branch!
 startup.1.t:0 "Hearts of Pokemon"
 startup.1.d:0 "Welcome to the Hearts of Pokemon mod! We are currently in a very, very early alpha and if you got your hands on this mod, please report any bugs you happen to find. This mod added a few mechanics that may be confusing, so we have some events to clear things up. We hope you enjoy Hearts of Pokemon!"
 startup.1.a:0 "Stability and World Tension"
 startup.1.b:0 "Achievements"
 startup.1.c:0 "Military Restrictions"
 startup.1.e:0 "I know everything!"
 startup.1.tt:0 "Cynthia Loves You!"
 startup.2.t:0 "Stability and World Tension effects"
 startup.2.d:0 "In Hearts of Pokemon, stability can go negative, down to -100%. Additionally, stability will slowly drift to 50% unless you are on disarmed nation, where it will drift to 100%. World Tension at low values further impedes armament and increases stability and world tension. \n \n At high world tension, there will be bonuses to war support and you will be able to form an army, but your stability will suffer."
 startup.2.a:0 "I understand."
 startup.3.t:0 "Achievements"
 startup.3.d:0 "The Hearts of Pokemon team has added in a custom achievement system. However, due to game limitations these achievements are not persistent. In the game rules section, there is a section for achievements, select whichever ones you have completed and save that layout to prevent the achievements from re-appearing. You can also disable the achievement system under that section."
 startup.3.a:0 "I understand."
 startup.4.t:0 "Military Restrictions"
 startup.4.d:0 "There are restrictions on researching most all weapons, naval mobile and air tech beyond pokemon based weapons, and doctrines until various world tension levels. Additionally, having too large an army under low world tension will incur negative penalties. Remember, this world hasn't seen major war before."
 startup.4.a:0 "I understand."
